            | It was many and many a year ago.
            br
            | 							In a kingdom by the sea,
            br
            | 							That a maiden there lived whom you may know
            br
            | 							By the name of ANNABEL LEE:
            br
            | 							And this maiden she lived with no other thought
            br
            | 							Than to love and be loved by me.
            br
        p
            | I was a child and she was a child,
            br
            | 							In this kingdom by the sea:
            br
            | 							But we loved with a love that was more than love --
            br
            | 							I and my ANNABEL LEE;
            br
            | 							With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
            br
            | 							Coveted her and me.
            br
        p
            | And this was the reason that, long ago,
            br
            | 							In this kingdom by the sea,
            br
            | 							A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
            br
            | 							My beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
            br
            | 							So that her high kinsman came
            br
            | 							And bore her away from me,
            br
            | 							To shut her up in a sepulchre
            br
            | 							In this kingdom by the sea.
            br
        p
            | The angels, not half so happy in heaven.
            br
            | 							Went envying her and me --
            br
            | 							Yes! -- that was the reason (as all men know
            br
            | 							In this kingdom by the sea)
            br
            | 							That this wind came out of the cloud by night,
            br
            | 							Chilling and killing my ANNABEL LEE.
            br
        p
            | But our love it was stronger by far than the love
            br
            | 							Of those who were older than we --
            br
            | 							Of many far wiser than we --
            br
            | 							And neither the angels in heaven above,
            br
            | 							Nor the demons down under the sea,
            br
            | 							Can ever dissever mv soul from the soul
            br
            | 							Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE.
            br
        p
            | For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
            br
            | 							Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
            br
            | 							And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
            br
            | 							Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE:
            br
            | 							And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
            br
            | 							Of my darling -- my darling -- my life and my bride,
            br
            | 							In the sepulchre there by the sea,
            br
            | 							In the tomb by the sounding sea.
